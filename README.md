# 🛰️ Wetland Detection from Satellite Imagery 🌿

A full-stack web application that detects and highlights wetland regions in satellite images using a U-Net deep learning model. The system enables users to upload satellite images, processes them in the backend using image segmentation techniques, and returns plotted results with analytical insights — all through a clean, responsive web interface.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads a satellite image via the frontend.
2. The backend receives the image, applies the U-Net segmentation model.
3. A binary wetland mask and plotted result image are generated and stored.
4. The frontend displays the results with wetland coverage percentage.
5. Users can download the result image directly.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 🔧 Backend (Flask)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
````

### 🌐 Frontend (React)

```bash
cd src
npm install
npm start
```

Make sure both frontend and backend are running simultaneously. Adjust CORS and proxy as needed.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To create an intelligent, accessible, and automated system that analyzes satellite images and identifies wetland areas using deep learning — providing both visual overlays and statistical insight for environmental monitoring and land use assessment.
